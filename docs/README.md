Basic Aviation Knowledge: Mission Control & Flight Dynamics Kernel
==================================================================

Overview
--------

This repository provides a high-fidelity aerospace simulation, navigation, and telemetry suite. Designed for modularity, it allows for high-precision orbital pathing, adaptive atmospheric entry control, and multi-contractor telemetry dispatch (NASA, Lockheed, Northrop, etc.).

Mission-Critical Capabilities
-----------------------------

### 1\. High-Fidelity Physics & Dynamics

-   **Advanced Entry Engine:** Atmospheric entry management utilizing Sutton-Graves stagnation heat flux models and PID-controlled bank-angle correction for storm drift.

-   **Energy Management:** Automated S-Turn maneuver injection to dissipate kinetic energy during high-angle or "too hot" arrivals.

-   **Performance Kernels:** Hot-path physics calculations (Rossby dynamics, icing models, thermodynamics) are accelerated via **Numba (`njit`)** and integrated multicore processing for near-real-time throughput.

### 2\. Mission Assurance & Compliance

-   **Config Validation:** Enforces strict Pydantic schema validation for all inputs (mass, area, G-loads). Rejects malformed configuration files before simulation start.

-   **Atomic Telemetry:** Utilizes file-locking (`fcntl`) for all binary telemetry exports (Lockheed 1553B, NASA HDF5), ensuring data integrity during high-throughput flight loops.

-   **Protocol Integrity:** Automated pre-flight checklists via `cli_main.py` verify that all six aerospace export protocols (Boeing, NASA, Lockheed, Axiom, Northrop, OAAM) are live and writing valid data.

### 3\. Integrated Interfaces

-   **Tactical CLI (`cli_main.py`):** Professionalized Typer-based command-line interface for mission control, protocol validation, and automated documentation generation.

-   **Cockpit TUI (`app.py`):** Asynchronous Textual dashboard for real-time flight monitoring, featuring non-blocking logging and parameter overriding.

Architecture & Integrity Note
-----------------------------

*To our operators:* The repository utilizes a **Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)**.

-   Your **High-Fidelity Math Kernels** (e.g., `aviation_physics.py`, `rossby_model.py`, `atmospheric_entry_controller.py`) remain in their standalone, deep-logic form.

-   The **Orchestration Shells** (`cli_main.py`, `app.py`) are strictly non-invasive wrappers. They import and execute your physics logic but do not alter or simplify the underlying computational fidelity.

Quick Start / Mission Commands
------------------------------
